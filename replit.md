# Overview

This is a full-stack aerospace company website for Cingularity Aerospaceâ„¢, built with React (client) and Express.js (server). The application serves as a modern corporate website featuring company information, services showcase, and a contact inquiry system. It's designed for an AS 9100 D & ISO 9001/2015 certified aerospace company specializing in UAV manufacturing, precision engineering, and defense solutions.

The system follows a modern TypeScript-first architecture with shared schemas between frontend and backend, comprehensive UI component library using shadcn/ui, and a clean separation of concerns between client and server code.
